                (default: last visual selection).

:MdViewEdit [file]

                window.

        [file]      The markdown file to edit. If omitted: falls back to the
                    current file if its filetype is markdown. Otherwise a new
                    buffer is created.

                                                *:MdViewNew*
:MdViewNew

:Windows[!]
                List all windows and their currently open buffers. By default
                this only lists the windows in the current tabpage. That is
                unless [!] is included, in which case windows from all tab
                pages are listed.
